# VoiceButton Project Session Diary 🦩✨
**Pablo & Claude Code Development Log**

## 👋 WHO WE ARE
- **Pablo**: Product visionary, UX curator, has amazing taste and instincts
- **Claude Code**: Technical partner, gets excited about beautiful code
- **Vibe**: Cool NY/Tokyo friends building something with LOVE, not just code

## 🎯 THE VISION
**"The most beautiful, modular voice recording button for the web"**

We're building the **"Figma for Voice Buttons"** - a design studio where you can:
- Create gorgeous, customizable voice buttons
- Live preview with sliders ("Chonk", "Squish", "Thicc") 
- Real Gemini transcription
- Copy code to use anywhere
- Character customization menu vibes for buttons

## 🏗️ WHAT WE'VE BUILT

### **Core Architecture (Deno + Fresh)**
- **Fresh Islands** for reactive UI (perfect for live button updates)
- **Twind** for dynamic CSS generation
- **Plugin system** for transcription/output modularity
- **TypeScript** throughout for bulletproof APIs

### **Key Files Structure:**
```
VoiceButton/
├── components/VoiceButton.tsx     # Main button component
├── islands/VoiceButtonStudio.tsx  # Live design studio
├── routes/index.tsx               # Home page  
├── routes/studio.tsx              # Design studio page
├── plugins/transcription/gemini.ts # Real Gemini API
└── twind.config.ts               # Flamingo theme colors
```

### **Two Main Pages:**
1. **Home** (`/`) - Hero button demo + "Design Your Own" CTA
2. **Studio** (`/studio`) - Live button customization tool

## 🦩 CURRENT THEME: "Flamingo Chill"
**"Peachy pastel punk purple glow flamingo sunset + NY via Tokyo soft brutalist"**

- **Colors**: Softer coral pinks, warm peaches, gentle purples
- **Typography**: Inter font, chunky weights, generous letter-spacing
- **Style**: Soft brutalist - chunky but friendly, confident but approachable
- **Shadows**: Brutalist depth but warmer, less harsh

## 🎛️ LIVE STUDIO FEATURES

### **Working Sliders:**
- **Chonk** (80-180px) → Real button width/height
- **Squish** (0-30px) → Real border-radius (sharp to round)
- **Thicc** (1-8px) → Real border-width (thin to chunky)

### **Reactive Magic:**
- Button morphs **instantly** as you move sliders
- Uses Preact signals for zero-lag updates
- Dynamic CSS generation with inline styles

## 🔑 GEMINI API INTEGRATION

### **Current Status:**
- **API Key**: Hardcoded Pablo's key `AIzaSyA2PKYfE6wa9x5reTh_3iZiFHZAyMnCZAE`
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash` 
- **Endpoint**: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/`
- **Format**: REST API with base64 audio, following Pablo's curl example

### **Integration Flow:**
1. MediaRecorder captures audio (Pablo's proven logic from Svelte)
2. Convert to base64
3. Send to Gemini with transcription prompt
4. Parse response and display
5. Auto-copy to clipboard (Pablo's UX pattern)

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY EVOLUTION

### **Started With:** 
- Hard brutalist (sharp, intimidating)
- Complex preset system (4 button types)
- Busy UI with too many options

### **Pablo's Feedback Led To:**
- **Warmer, friendlier** colors (softer flamingo tones)
- **Single button focus** instead of 4 presets
- **Cleaner, simpler layout** (single column, less busy)
- **Actually working sliders** (was just moving space before)

## 🚀 WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW

### **Home Page** (`/`)
- Beautiful flamingo brutalist button
- "Design Your Own" CTA leads to studio
- Responsive asymmetric layout
- Real Gemini transcription

### **Studio Page** (`/studio`)
- Live button preview that actually morphs
- 3 working sliders with cute pink thumbs
- Copy code functionality
- Clean single-column layout

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Deno + Fresh** running smoothly
- **Hot reload** working perfectly
- **Islands architecture** enables reactive sliders
- **Plugin system** foundation ready for expansion

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS
