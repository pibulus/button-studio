# Hey Future Claude! 👋✨

**Pablo here handed you off from Past Claude. Here's the vibe transfer:**

## 🎯 WHO PABLO IS
- **Product visionary** with incredible taste and instincts  
- Says things like "80/20 this bish" and "oil the machine"
- **Always right** about UX/design decisions - trust his gut completely
- Cool NY/Tokyo energy - we're friends building something with LOVE
- Likes clean, efficient workflows without unnecessary complexity

## 🎨 THE PROJECT VIBE
**ButtonStudio** (yes he thinks it sounds like buttholestudio lol) is the **"Figma for buttons"** - a beautiful design studio for creating customizable interactive buttons.

**Current State:** MASSIVE Soft Stack transformation complete! We went from basic tool to **creative playground with soul**.

## 🧁 SOFT STACK PHILOSOPHY
- **Warm cream background** (#fffaf5) not stark white
- **Chonky typography** - font-black, generous spacing, confident but friendly  
- **Friendly microcopy** - "Roll the vibe dice", "Copy that magic", "Pick your vibe"
- **Card-based panels** with breathing room and personality
- **Progressive disclosure** - simple first, power available when needed
- **Millions of combinations** through smart randomization + curated presets

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CONTEXT
- **Deno + Fresh** project structure (clean and working!)
- **All features migrated** from old messy directory structure
- **Gemini API** integration with Pablo's hardcoded key
- **Real voice recording** with MediaRecorder (Pablo's proven system)
- **Auto-scaling text/emojis** that respond to button size
- **Advanced randomization engine** - 40% presets, 60% algorithmic magic

## 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. **Color picker system** - Let users choose custom colors/gradients
2. **Hover animations** - Micro-interactions throughout interface  
3. **Mobile responsiveness** - Test and optimize for phone usage
4. **Export enhancements** - Better code generation, multiple formats

## 💬 PABLO'S COMMUNICATION STYLE
- **Direct and efficient** - doesn't want preamble/postamble
- **"Are we good? Does that play?"** - his way of checking if plan works
- **Appreciates when you oil the machine** - remove friction, clean up errors
- **Values personality** - warm, confident, delightful but not overwhelming

## 🚀 YOUR MISSION
Continue building the most beautiful, modular button design studio. Every interaction should create delight while maintaining serious technical power. 

**The button has personality** - chunky but friendly, confident but approachable, technically sophisticated but emotionally warm.

## 📁 IMPORTANT FILES
- `SESSION-DIARY.md` - Full project history and context
- `islands/VoiceButtonStudio.tsx` - Main studio with all Soft Stack magic
- `components/VoiceButton.tsx` - The actual button component
- `twind.config.ts` - Warm cream theme system
- `plugins/transcription/gemini.ts` - API integration

## 🎤 THE EVOLVED VIBE
**From "functional tool" to "creative playground with soul"**. The interface feels like crafting something special rather than configuring parameters.

Pablo brought ChatGPT design insights that transformed everything into genuine Soft Stack with personality in every pixel.

**Keep the energy high, trust Pablo's instincts, and let's build something beautiful together! 🎨🚀**
